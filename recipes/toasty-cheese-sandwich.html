        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Let's be serious. You don't have time to mess around during lunch. 
            Jump out of online meetings, throw a few of these into the oven, toast and chow-down. 
            Then get back to work! Serves 1-2.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cheap, pre-sliced bread. Not wonder bread though, 
                the things have to survive long enough for the cheese to melt people!</li>
            <li>Pre-sliced cheddar because, again seriously, you don't have time</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Something that can toast stuff, but not your toaster. Seriously, don't do that</li>
            <li>Baking sheet (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to broil, leave the door cracked-open while cooking</li>
            <li>Throw slices on a baking sheet or, if you like them crunchy and don't mind making a mess, 
                directly on the rack</li>
            <li>Cook until cheese is melty, bread is toasty, but not until the fire alarm goes off</li>
            <li>Remove and allow to cool for 2-3 minutes while you dial into the next meeting</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy with your work mates. Don't chew with your mouth open.</p>
